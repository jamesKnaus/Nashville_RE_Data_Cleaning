# Nashville Housing Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis skills using Nashville housing data through three main steps:

1) Data Cleaning: Using SQL to clean and standardize raw housing data, addressing issues like inconsistent formatting, missing values, and data quality problems.

2) Database Views: Creating optimized SQL views to structure the cleaned data for efficient access and analysis, setting the foundation for more complex queries.

3) Analysis and Visualization: Employing Python to perform in-depth data analysis on the prepared dataset and create visualizations that illustrate key housing market trends and insights.

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- SQL Database Management
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (T-SQL)

## Project Structure
1. **Data Cleaning**: SQL scripts to standardize formats, handle missing values, and improve data quality.
2. **Database Management**: Creation of optimized tables and views for efficient data access.
3. **Data Analysis**: Python scripts for in-depth statistical analysis and data exploration.
4. **Visualization**: Charts and graphs illustrating key housing market trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run SQL scripts to set up the database and views
4. Execute Python scripts for analysis and visualization
